def index(request) from https://github.com/Team-Ace/fs_site/blob/master/freesources/views.py

Reader: Yixuan
Recorder: Erik

Notes:
1. The index function does not provide error message when the add item form is not valid and not inserted to database, user might get confused;
2. The select sql script is very long and might cause user to wait for a long time before the index page is loaded;
3. There are inserted javascript code in the index.html file, which is not very neat;
