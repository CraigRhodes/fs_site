function onMapClick(e) from https://github.com/Team-Ace/fs_site/blob/master/freesources/static/js/map.js

Notes:
storedMarkers & visibleMarkers variables are both global variables for keeping track of markers in regards to filter functionality. 
Perhaps models should be used for markers.
line 20 - hardcoding of accessing data in a selected marker in storedMarkers
  - what if data format is changed?
line 27 - console.log() not needed
A lot of commented out code that should be parsed to determine usefulness. If not useful, perhaps it should just be removed.
The asynchronous code is retrospectively a definite step in the right direction.
